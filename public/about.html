<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a master's student in architecture with a strong academic foundation and diverse professional
  experiences. My journey in the architectural field began with my Bachelor of Science in Architecture,
  where I developed a passion for designing spaces that are both innovative and meaningful. This
  passion led to my recognition as an Asia Young Design (AYDA) finalist for my Sarawak Culture Centre
  project, where I showcased my ability to merge cultural essence with modern architectural solutions.</p>
 
<p>Professionally, I’ve been involved in a variety of impactful projects. I contributed to the redesign of
  Bukit Mertajam Pasar in Penang, working closely with my team to revitalize the market while
  and rendering visuals for a serviced apartment proposal for the LTAT Group. 
  Additionally, I collaborated with the University of Malaya to propose an outdoor learning space for
  the campus kindergarten, integrating landscape design to enhance the learning experience for children.</p>

  <p>My specialization lies in 3D modeling and rendering, using tools like SketchUp and Enscape to bring
    design ideas to life with a focus on materiality and detail. As a freelancer, I’ve refined these skills,
    building a portfolio that showcases my ability to transform concepts into visually compelling designs.
    Beyond architecture, I am exploring the world of coding, with interests in software, web, and app
    development. I see this as an opportunity to bridge the gap between design and technology,
    opening new avenues for creativity and problem-solving in architecture and beyond.</p>
